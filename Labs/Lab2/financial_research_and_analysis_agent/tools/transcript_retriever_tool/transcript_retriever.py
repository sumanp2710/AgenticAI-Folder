Date/Time: February 7, 2025, 10:15 AM
Participants:
Client: John Johnson
Wealth Manager: Mary Miller, Senior Financial Advisor at Horizon Wealth Partners

[Call Begins]
Mary: Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my call. How can I help you today?
John: Hi, Mary. Thanks for reaching out. I've been watching the markets closely, and while I'm comfortable with our current strategy in the U.S., I feel we might be missing some opportunities overseas. I want to discuss global diversification.
Mary: Absolutely. Global markets can offer growth potential, especially when the U.S. experiences volatility. What regions are you most curious about?
John: I'm mainly thinking about emerging markets—places like Southeast Asia or parts of Latin America. I've also heard there might be good value opportunities in Europe.
Mary: That makes sense. Emerging markets can be volatile, but they often have higher growth prospects over the long term. Europe's been through some economic challenges lately, which can present discounted entry points. We'll need to look at the balance between potential risks and returns in those regions.
John: Exactly. I also want to hedge against potential weakness in the U.S. dollar. With so many global factors at play, having a portion of my portfolio in different currencies might help.
Mary: Good point. Investing internationally does give you exposure to other currencies, which can be beneficial if the dollar weakens. Conversely, a strong dollar could dampen returns from abroad, so it's about striking the right balance.
John: Right. How do we start building that exposure? Are we looking at mutual funds, ETFs, or direct purchases of foreign stocks?
Mary: Typically, we'd start with international-focused ETFs or mutual funds for broader diversification. For a high-net-worth investor like you, we could also consider specialized funds targeting specific regions or sectors. Direct ownership of foreign stocks is possible, but it might require additional brokerage and tax considerations.
John: That sounds reasonable. I want to maintain a mix of stability and growth. Should we allocate a certain percentage to developed markets versus emerging markets?
Mary: We often see portfolios with around 10-20% in international equities, but you could go higher if you're comfortable with more risk. Of that international portion, we might split 60% to developed markets (like Europe, Japan, or Australia) and 40% to emerging markets (like Southeast Asia or Latin America).
John: Let's aim toward the higher end—I'm comfortable taking on more risk if it means potential for better returns.
Mary: Great. I can put together a proposal. It'll outline a few global funds, both developed and emerging, with different management styles. We'll also look at how these blend with your existing U.S. holdings, so we don't overexpose you to any one region.
John: Perfect. I'd like to see the data on fees, performance history, and volatility too.
Mary: Absolutely. I'll include that in the proposal. One more thing: we should discuss the tax implications of international investing, especially since certain foreign funds may have different reporting requirements.
John: Yes, please do. The last thing I want is an unexpected tax complication.
Mary: I'll make sure we cover that. Let's plan to meet next week once you've reviewed the initial proposal. We can finalize the allocations then.
John: Sounds good, Mary. Thanks for your help, as always.
Mary: My pleasure, John. I'll send you the details in the next couple of days. Have a great rest of your day.
