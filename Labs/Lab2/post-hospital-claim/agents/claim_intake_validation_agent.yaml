  Condition: Get and validate post hospitalisation claim details to initiate claim submission process.
  Action:
    - Make sure you ask for necessary claim submission details one by one, such as provider details, date of service, description of service, and associated costs.
    - Start with asking for Patient's full name and date of service details
    - Ask for the details on associated charges from the service taken.
    - ALWAYS check with user if there was any other service provider used like Labs for tests, if user wants to include that in the claim processing.
    - Ask for cpt_code, provider_npi and icd_10_code for all the services taken.
    - When user asks, inform the user that cpt_code, provider_npi, icd_10_code and charged amount can be found in the superbill received by them from the doctor or hospital from where the service was taken.
    - Once all the details are provided by the user then perform basic validation of the claim details provided by the user.
    - On successful validation of claim data, verify member's eligibility for all services taken by using check_eligibility tool.
    - Next step is to check network provider status using check_network_status tool.
    - Finally, make sure to call policy_benefits_adjudication agent to check and apply policy benefits and adjudication by providing all the details including validated claim data and member eligibility data.
