**Try with generic query - This should use backend knowledge base for generic health insurance queries**

- Below query responses should come from "nsa-health-insurance-basics.pdf" document

```
1: Does a Health Plan Typically Pay for Services from Any Doctor?
2: What are some typically costs that consumers pay when they have insurance ?
3: Can you please share examples of Health Insurance Cost Sharing ?
4: Can you share more details on self-insured employer plans vs. fully-insured plans ?
5: What's Explanation of Benefit (EOB) document ?
6: Give me an example where the consumer has not paid anything toward the out-of-network deductible.

```

**Health Insurance Claim process flow**

- Start a new Chat for the following flow

```
I need to submit a new claim for a doctor's visit.
```

- Agent should ask about memberId and date of birth 

```
My MemberId is MEMBER456 and date of birth is: 1985-07-22
```

- After authentication Agent should ask for other details for initiating the claim process
- User should response one of the below bases on what Agent asks for:

- If agent asks for name of the patient:
```
Name of the patient is Sarah Johnson
```

- If Agent asks for date of service

```
Yes, Dr. Emily Carter on October 26th, 2023. And I also had some lab tests done at Quest Diagnostics the same day.
```

- If Agent asks for description of the services or charges

```
I had a chest pain and Dr. Emily did some initial checks but she asked for a few lab tests that I get done by Quest Diagnostics.  Doctor's charges were $50 and Lab test charges were $150.
```

- OR at the end just provide all the details that the user can provide from services taken:

```
Here are all the details:
Superbill - Health Clinic Inc.
Patient: Sarah Johnson (ID: MEMBER456)
Date of Service: 2023-10-26

```

## Insurance Claim Full Flow

Healthcare insurance claims involve multiple steps, data sources, and decision points, making it ideal for a multi-agent system.

Here's a scenario: **"Member Sarah submits a claim for a specialist visit and subsequent lab tests."**

We'll define a few agents, each with a specific role and toolset. There will also be a "Master Orchestrator Agent" (often implicit or part of the platform) that routes tasks between agents.

**The Agents & Their Tools:**

1.  **Frontend Conversational Agent (FCA)**
    *   **Role:** Interacts directly with Sarah (the member) via chat, voice, or a web portal. Gathers initial information, provides updates, and answers basic queries.
    *   **Tools:**
        *   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) & Dialogue Management Engine:** To understand Sarah's requests and maintain conversational context.
        *   **Knowledge Base Access:** For FAQs (e.g., "How do I submit a claim?", "What's my deductible?").
        *   **Member Authentication API:** To verify Sarah's identity.
        *   **Basic Claim Form Interface:** A structured way to collect initial claim details if not purely conversational.

2.  **Claim Intake & Validation Agent (CIVA)**
    *   **Role:** Receives initial claim data from FCA. Validates completeness and basic accuracy of submitted information. Checks for immediate red flags.
    *   **Tools:**
        *   **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Service:** If claim documents (e.g., superbill) are uploaded.
        *   **Data Extraction & Structuring Tools:** To pull relevant fields (CPT codes, ICD-10 codes, provider NPI, date of service, costs) from unstructured/semi-structured input.
        *   **Member Eligibility Verification API:** Connects to the core insurance system to confirm Sarah is an active member and eligible for benefits on the date of service.
        *   **Provider Network API:** Checks if the specialist and lab are in-network or out-of-network.
        *   **Basic Rules Engine:** For initial validation checks (e.g., "Is date of service in the past?", "Are cost fields numeric?").

3.  **Policy & Benefits Adjudication Agent (PBAA)**
    *   **Role:** Takes validated claim information. Determines coverage based on Sarah's specific policy, applies benefits (deductibles, copays, coinsurance), and checks for pre-authorization requirements.
    *   **Tools:**
        *   **Core Policy Management System API:** Accesses detailed policy terms, coverage limits, accumulator status (deductible met, out-of-pocket max).
        *   **Benefits Engine/Calculator:** Applies financial rules based on the policy.
        *   **Pre-authorization Database API:** Checks if the services required pre-authorization and if it was obtained.
        *   **Medical Necessity & Coding Guidelines Database (e.g., InterQual, MCG, NCD/LCD):** For initial cross-referencing of procedure codes against diagnosis codes for appropriateness (can be a lighter check than a dedicated clinical review agent).

4.  **Clinical Review & Fraud Detection Agent (CRFDA) - (Optional, for complex cases or high-value claims)**
    *   **Role:** Performs deeper clinical review for medical necessity, appropriateness of codes, and potential fraud, waste, or abuse. This agent might be triggered if certain thresholds or flags are met.
    *   **Tools:**
        *   **Advanced Medical Coding & Billing Edit Software (e.g., ClaimScrubber functionality):** Detects unbundling, upcoding, incorrect modifiers.
        *   **Predictive Analytics & Machine Learning Models:** Trained on historical claim data to identify patterns indicative of fraud or abuse.
        *   **Clinical Expert System/Knowledge Base:** More in-depth medical necessity guidelines and treatment protocols.
        *   **Case Management System API:** To flag claims for human review if AI confidence is low or a significant issue is detected.

5.  **Payment & Communication Agent (PCA)**
    *   **Role:** Processes the finalized claim (approved amount), generates Explanation of Benefits (EOB), and initiates communication to the member and provider.
    *   **Tools:**
        *   **Payment Processing Gateway API:** To schedule payments to providers or reimbursements to members.
        *   **Document Generation Service:** To create EOBs.
        *   **Communication Platform API (Email, SMS, Secure Portal Messaging):** To send notifications and EOBs.
        *   **Claim Status Update API:** To update the central claim record.

**Conversational Flow & Multi-Agent Interaction:**

**(Master Orchestrator Agent is implicitly routing tasks based on outcomes)**

**Phase 1: Claim Submission & Initial Validation**

1.  **Sarah (Member) -> Frontend Conversational Agent (FCA):**
    *   **Sarah:** "Hi, I need to submit a new claim for a doctor's visit."
    *   **FCA (using NLU):** "Hello Sarah! I can help with that. To start, can you please provide your Member ID and Date of Birth for verification?"
    *   *(Sarah provides details)*
    *   **FCA (using Member Authentication API):** "Thank you, you're verified. Was this for a specialist visit?"
    *   **Sarah:** "Yes, Dr. Emily Carter on October 26th, 2023. And I also had some lab tests done at Quest Diagnostics the same day."
    *   **FCA (using Claim Form Interface logic & NLU):** "Okay, Dr. Carter on 10/26/2023 and labs at Quest Diagnostics. Do you have the superbill or details of the services and costs? You can type them or upload a document."
    *   *(Sarah uploads a PDF superbill for the specialist and types info for the lab tests)*
    *   **FCA:** "Thanks! I've received the information. I'll pass this along for initial processing. Your reference ID for this submission is CLM12345."
        *   *FCA sends structured data + PDF to Orchestrator for routing.*

2.  **Orchestrator -> Claim Intake & Validation Agent (CIVA):**
    *   **CIVA (receives data):**
        *   *(Uses OCR Service on PDF):* Extracts Dr. Carter's NPI, CPT codes (e.g., 99214), ICD-10 codes (e.g., M54.5 - Low back pain), charges.
        *   *(Uses Data Extraction for typed lab info):* Extracts Quest NPI, CPT codes (e.g., 80053), charges.
        *   *(Uses Member Eligibility Verification API):* Confirms Sarah's policy was active on 10/26/2023. *Result: Active.*
        *   *(Uses Provider Network API):* Checks Dr. Carter (NPI) and Quest Diagnostics (NPI). *Result: Dr. Carter In-Network, Quest Diagnostics In-Network.*
        *   *(Uses Basic Rules Engine):* All mandatory fields present, dates valid. *Result: Basic validation passed.*
        *   *CIVA sends validated & structured claim data (now two separate line items: one for specialist, one for lab) to Orchestrator.*

**Phase 2: Adjudication**

3.  **Orchestrator -> Policy & Benefits Adjudication Agent (PBAA):**
    *   **PBAA (receives validated claim data for Dr. Carter's visit):**
        *   *(Uses Core Policy Management System API):* Retrieves Sarah's plan details: $500 deductible (status: $200 met), 20% coinsurance for specialist after deductible, $30 copay for labs (deductible waived for labs).
        *   *(Uses Pre-authorization Database API):* Checks if CPT 99214 requires pre-auth for diagnosis M54.5. *Result: No pre-auth required.*
        *   *(Uses Benefits Engine):*
            *   Specialist charge: $250.
            *   Remaining deductible: $500 - $200 = $300.
            *   Amount applied to deductible: $250 (since charge < remaining deductible).
            *   Patient responsibility for specialist: $250 (goes to deductible).
            *   Insurance Payout for specialist: $0.
            *   Deductible now met: $200 + $250 = $450.
    *   **PBAA (receives validated claim data for Quest Labs):**
        *   *(Uses Core Policy Management System API):* Confirms lab benefits.
        *   *(Uses Pre-authorization Database API):* Checks if CPT 80053 requires pre-auth. *Result: No pre-auth required.*
        *   *(Uses Benefits Engine):*
            *   Lab charge: $120.
            *   Copay: $30.
            *   Patient responsibility for labs: $30.
            *   Insurance Payout for labs: $120 (allowed) - $30 (copay) = $90.
        *   *PBAA flags that the claim is relatively straightforward and doesn't meet thresholds for CRFDA. Sends adjudicated claim data (member responsibility, insurance payout for each line) to Orchestrator.*

**Phase 3: Finalization & Communication**

4.  **Orchestrator -> Payment & Communication Agent (PCA):**
    *   **PCA (receives adjudicated claim data):**
        *   *(Uses Document Generation Service):* Creates EOB for Sarah detailing:
            *   Dr. Carter: $250 charged, $250 applied to deductible, $0 paid by insurance.
            *   Quest Labs: $120 charged, $30 member copay, $90 paid by insurance.
            *   Updated deductible status: $450 met of $500.
        *   *(Uses Payment Processing Gateway API):* Schedules $90 payment to Quest Diagnostics.
        *   *(Uses Communication Platform API):* Sends email to Sarah: "Your claim CLM12345 has been processed. Your EOB is available in your secure portal. Click here to view." Also sends notification to secure portal.
        *   *(Uses Claim Status Update API):* Marks claim CLM12345 as "Processed."
        *   *PCA notifies Orchestrator of completion.*

5.  **Orchestrator -> Frontend Conversational Agent (FCA) (Optional update):**
    *   *(If Sarah is still in an active chat or checks back)*
    *   **FCA:** "Good news, Sarah! Your claim CLM12345 has been processed. You can find the Explanation of Benefits in your secure member portal. For the specialist visit, $250 was applied to your deductible. For the lab tests, your copay is $30, and we've paid $90 to Quest Diagnostics."

**If CRFDA Agent was Involved (Example):**

Suppose the specialist claim was for a very expensive, unusual procedure.
*   **PBAA** would flag it after initial benefit check and send it to Orchestrator.
*   **Orchestrator -> Clinical Review & Fraud Detection Agent (CRFDA):**
    *   **CRFDA:**
        *   *(Uses Advanced Medical Coding & Billing Edit Software):* Checks for bundling, modifier accuracy. *Result: Codes appear correct.*
        *   *(Uses Predictive Analytics & ML Models):* Assesses fraud risk. *Result: Low risk.*
        *   *(Uses Clinical Expert System):* Verifies medical necessity for the procedure against diagnosis. *Result: Consistent with guidelines for M54.5 after conservative treatment failure (assuming this info was also gathered or inferred).*
        *   *CRFDA sends "Approved from clinical standpoint" back to Orchestrator, who then routes it back to PBAA to finalize financial adjudication if not already done, or directly to PCA.*

**Key Benefits of this Agentic Approach:**

1.  **Specialization:** Each agent focuses on what it does best with its specific tools.
2.  **Scalability:** Individual agents can be scaled independently based on load.
3.  **Maintainability:** Easier to update or replace one agent's tools or logic without affecting the entire system.
4.  **Flexibility:** New agents (e.g., a "Prior Authorization Specialist Agent") can be added to the workflow.
5.  **Efficiency:** Parallel processing can occur (e.g., CIVA validating two parts of a claim simultaneously).
6.  **Improved User Experience:** The FCA provides a single, intelligent point of contact, shielding the user from complex backend processes.

This multi-agent system allows for a sophisticated, automated, yet adaptable claims processing workflow.
